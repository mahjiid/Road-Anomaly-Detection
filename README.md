# Road-Anomaly-Detection

# Road Anomaly Detection
# Overview
Road Anomaly Detection is a final year project focused on identifying anomalies on road surfaces using machine learning techniques. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to detect irregularities such as potholes, cracks, or obstacles, aiding in road maintenance and safety.

# Features
Real-time Anomaly Detection: Processes video or image input to identify road anomalies.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes trained models for accurate detection of potholes, cracks, and other road irregularities.

Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for preparing and augmenting road image datasets.

Model Evaluation: Provides tools to evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Repository Structure

data/: Contains datasets or scripts for data preprocessing.

models/: Includes trained machine learning models or model architectures.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

src/: Source code for anomaly detection and related utilities.

requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
